#+TITLE: trojan

* Introduction

This is a fork of [[https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan][trojan]], written in C++, I use this to learn and experiment features that I'm interested in, like:
- [X] websocket support
- [X] socks proxy
- [ ] http proxy
- [ ] [[https://github.com/st31ny/smux][smux]] support

* build

#+begin_src shell
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON ..
  make
#+end_src

* Run

I'll write a detailed blog on setting up trojan.

* GUI

I plan to build a simple qt app later (busy at the moment) with more features like:
- PAC support
- system proxy
- import/export configuration

* Development

** Code Style

#+begin_src shell
  find . -regex '.*\.\(cpp\|hpp\|cc\|cxx\)' -exec clang-format -style=file -i {} \;
#+end_src
